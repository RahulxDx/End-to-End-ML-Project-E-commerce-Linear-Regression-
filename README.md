# E-Commerce ML (End-to-End)

A machine learning project implementing Linear Regression to analyze and predict e-commerce metrics using Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow using Linear Regression to analyze e-commerce data. The implementation is done entirely in Jupyter Notebook, making it ideal for both learning and practical applications in the e-commerce domain.

## 🎯 Features

- Complete end-to-end ML pipeline implementation
- Linear Regression model for e-commerce predictions
- Data analysis and visualization
- Model performance evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
- Saved model for future use (`regmodel.pkl`)

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **Implementation**: Jupyter Notebook (100%)
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Major Libraries**:
  - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - scikit-learn: Machine learning implementation
  - numpy: Numerical computations
  - matplotlib/seaborn: Data visualization
  - pickle: Model serialization
